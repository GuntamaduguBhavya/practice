
What is Test Case :

A test case template is a document that comes under one of the test artifacts, which allows testers to develop the test cases for a particular test scenario in order to verify whether the features of an application are working as intended or not.

 Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario which has a set of pre-conditions, test data, expected results, post-conditions, and actual results.



Test Scenario: Test Scenario gives the idea of what we have to test. Test Scenario is like a high-level test case.


Test Scenario vs Test Case : 


The main difference between test cases and test scenarios is that test cases are specific instructions that can be used to test a particular function or feature of an application, while test scenarios are high-level descriptions of how a specific function or feature of an application should work.


Who Writes Test Cases?
 
Assuming that a team contains developers and dedicated testers then it might be something like a joint effort.

Developers write Unit Tests
Developers & Testers write Integration Tests
Testers write Acceptance Tests



How To Write Test Cases in Manual Testing : 

Step 1 – Test Case ID
Step 2 – Test Case Description
Step 3 – Pre-Conditions
Step 4 – Test Steps
Step 5 – Test Data
Step 6 – Expected Result
Step 7 –  Post Condition
Step 8 – Actual Result
Step 9 – Status
