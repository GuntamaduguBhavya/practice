What are agile user stories?

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework.A user story is a concise description of a feature or requirement from the perspective of an end-user.  It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks like epics and initiatives. Epics are large work items broken down into a set of stories, and multiple epics comprise an initiative. 




Why create user stories?

Stories enable collaboration

When I click on the link,
Then I should be redirected to a page where I can create a new password.
Given that I successfully reset my password,
When I try to login with my new password,
Then I should be able to access my account without any issues.
